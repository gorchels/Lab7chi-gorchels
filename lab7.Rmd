What did the fish say when it swam into a wall? 

Dam!! 

Where did the general put his armies?

Into his sleevies! 

I am reaaaally stumped on this one!! 

Why are there spaces between your fingers? 


1. Loading the tidyverse and reading in the data 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
gc_df = read_csv("gc_df.csv")
#View(gc_df)

get_guns = gc_df %>% 
  filter(gender != "NA", make_get_guns != "NA") %>% 
  count(gender, make_get_guns) %>% 
  spread(make_get_guns, n) %>% 
  select(-gender) 
  
  rownames(get_guns) =c("Female", "Male")
#View(get_guns)
```
